# TriangleDraw-Community

Show room for TriangleDraw artists.

I have posted my TriangleDraw drawings on Instagram and Reddit, and I no longer want to support social media platforms.

I think it's better to have a dedicated repository for drawings, where everyone can submit their drawings.

Greetings from Simon Strandgaard, the developer of TriangleDraw.

Feel free to write to me: `hello@triangledraw.com`
